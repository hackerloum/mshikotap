# Advanced Fix for User Registration Error

This guide provides an enhanced solution for the persistent "Database error saving new user" issue with Supabase authentication.

## The Issue

The error occurs because:

1. Supabase has strict Row Level Security (RLS) policies
2. The user profile creation happens before auth verification is complete
3. There's a race condition between auth and profile creation

## Comprehensive Solution

This solution uses a server-side API route with admin privileges to bypass RLS policies entirely:

### 1. Server-Side API Route

We've created a server-side API route at `/api/create-user-profile` that:
- Uses the Supabase service role key to bypass RLS
- Creates the user profile with admin privileges
- Handles error cases gracefully

### 2. Separated Auth and Profile Creation

The AuthForm component now:
- First creates just the auth user
- Then calls the server-side API to create the profile
- Continues even if profile creation initially fails (can be fixed later)

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

The new approach includes:
- Detailed error logging
- Graceful error recovery
- User-friendly error messages

## Implementation Steps

1. **Update Your Environment Variables**:
   Make sure your `.env.local` file has the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` properly set

2. **Apply the Code Changes**:
   - Update the `AuthForm.tsx` component
   - Add the new `src/app/api/create-user-profile/route.ts` file

3. **Deploy Your Changes**:
   - Commit and push these changes to your repository
   - Redeploy to Netlify

4. **Test Registration**:
   - Try registering again
   - Check browser console for any errors
   - Check Netlify logs if issues persist

## Explanation of How It Works

1. When a user registers, we first create the auth user in Supabase Auth
2. After successful auth creation, we call our server-side API
3. The API uses the service role key to bypass RLS and create the profile
4. Even if there's an issue with profile creation, the auth user is still created
5. The user can log in and their profile can be created/fixed later

## Further Troubleshooting

If issues persist after implementing this solution:

1. **Check Network Requests**:
   - Look for any failed requests in the browser developer tools
   - Examine error responses from Supabase or your API

2. **Check Netlify Environment Variables**:
   - Verify the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is correctly set in Netlify

3. **Test Locally First**:
   - Test the solution locally before deploying
   - Check for any environment differences

4. **Contact Supabase Support**:
   - If all else fails, reach out to Supabase support with detailed error logs
